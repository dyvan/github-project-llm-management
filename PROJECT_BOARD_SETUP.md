## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Using the Project Board

### Velocity Tracking
Count total effort (story points) per week to calculate velocity:
```
Week 1: 13 points completed
Week 2: 18 points completed
Average velocity: ~15 points/week
```

### Sprint Planning
Group items by target version:
- v1.0: Initial release
- v1.1: Language support
- v1.2: Integrations

### Priority Matrix
Use Status + Priority to prioritize:
```
High Priority + Ready    = Start immediately
High Priority + Backlog  = Prioritize next
Medium Priority + Ready  = Start when possible
Low Priority + Backlog   = Consider for future
```
